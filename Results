EEG results summary
The EEG data were analyzed by using a cluster-based permutation test within the Mass Univariate Toolbox within MATLAB. 
This permutation test is based on a repeated measures t-statistic using every time point at each electrode.

Three time window of interests:
(1)  First fixation time window: 0 to -300 msec
(2)  First noun (N1) time window: 0 to 500 msec
(3)  Second noun (N2) time window: 0 to 500 msec


Analysis: Three bias conditions (Inst-biased, Equi-biased, Mod-biased condition) * look regions (Target animal or Target instrument)


(1)  First fixation time window: 0 to -300 msec
