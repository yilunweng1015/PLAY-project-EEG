EEG results summary
The EEG data were analyzed by using a cluster-based permutation test within the Mass Univariate Toolbox within MATLAB. 
This permutation test is based on a repeated measures t-statistic using every time point at each electrode from 0 to -300 ms for the first fixation time window, 
0 to 500 ms for the first noun time window and 0 to 500 ms for the second time window.
